### This is a continuation of the PlanMyTrip app. Feedback from the beta testers has been recieved. One of the biggest recommendations was to take it to the next level. Recommendations include adding the weather description to the weather data. Then, filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations as well as nearby hotels. From the list of desired destinations, the beta tester will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Lastly, using Google Maps Directions API, I created a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
